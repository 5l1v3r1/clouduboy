Learning to code might be the handiest skill of the XXI. century - but finding motivation to do so seems to be the hardest part. Even when one decides to embark on this journey, their path is often hindered by the lack or quality of tools, resources they will be using, and are often turned away by the lack of success and their feeling of "coding is not for me" is often reinforced by all these negative experiences.
This is where Happy Code Friends, Code Invaders and Clouduboy tries to help - introduce coding, hardware and IoT in a friendly, impulse-rich, exciting environment to anyone willing to give computers a try.

Happy Code Friends is a "free one-day coding bootcamp" type of initiative to introduce anyone to web technologies and coding in general, with the intention to give them a taste of the bright side of computer programming, and start them on a way of learning coding self-sufficiently. Code Invaders is a free online webpage/tutorial teaching basic JavaScript programming concepts by building an online game. Clouduboy is a free web-based tool for creating HTML5 games with JavaScript and running/playing them on tiny microcontrollers.
